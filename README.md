# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature importance analysis, model training, and evaluation using a Random Forest classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including demographic details, ticket class, and survival status.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features for better model performance.
3. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying key features contributing to model predictions.
4. **Model Training:** Using a Random Forest classifier to predict survival.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd titanic-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and results.

## Usage
- Open `Titanic_ML_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Model comparison with Logistic Regression, SVM, or XGBoost.
